TDD --- Test driven developement framework 
TestNG help us to design out test cases in a systematic way. 
we can drive our test cases using testNG. 

http://dl.bintray.com/testng-team/testng-eclipse-release/

testNG helps us to write test cases with the help of annotation. 
pre condition , post condition annotation and test annotations provided by testNG. 


TestNG Annotations
@Test :  To mark a method as a test method
@BeforeMethod: Executes before each test (@Test) method. this must be in same class where test case is written, else it will not run 
@AfterMethod: Executes after each test (@Test) method. this must be in same class where test case is written, else it will not run 
@BeforeClass: Executes before the first test method in the current class. this must be in same class where test case is written, else it will not run
@AfterClass: Executes after all the test methods in a current class. this must be in same class where test case is written, else it will not run

@BeforeTest: Executes before any test methods of available classes which are inside the <test> tag in the testng.xml in this suite.
this can be in same or different class where test case is written, it will run
@AfterTest: Executes after all the test methods of available classes which are inside the <test> tag in the testng.xml in this suite.
this can be in same or different class where test case is written, it will run
@BeforeSuite: Executes before all the tests in this suite.
this can be in same or different class where test case is written, it will run
@AfterSuite: Executes after all tests executed in this current suite.
this can be in same or different class where test case is written, it will run

@BeforeGroup: Executes before the first test method run in that specified group
@AfterGroup: Executes after the end of all the test methods executed in that specified group
TestNG have more annotations like @BeforeGroup, @AfterGroup, @Listeners, @Parameters, @DataProvider, @Factory.  These will be covered in next posts.

Sequence of Execution of the annotations:
BeforeSuite
BeforeTest
BeforeClass
BeforeMethod
Test
AfterMethod
AfterClass
AfterTest
AfterSuite
Here is the code to show the sequence of execution.

Class ‘SampleTestngUsage’ contains annotations @BeforeTest, @BeforeSuite, @AfterTest & @AfterSuite
Class ‘AnnotationsTest’ contains annotations @Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @beforeClass, @AfterClass, 


test result :
From BeforeSuite annotation in SampleTestngUsage class ..
From BeforeTest annotation in SampleTestngUsage class ..
From BeforeClass annotation test in AnnotationsTest class....
From BeforeMethod annotation in AnnotationsTest....
From first test annotated in AnnotationsTest....
